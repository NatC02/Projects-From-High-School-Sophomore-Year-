# Projects-From-High-School-Sophomore-Year-
Some of the projects that I have done in school
I have been coding since Freshman Year with Android Studio in my previous course and continued on my own thoughout high school
I first became interested in being a software engineer when I was in 7th grade and by 8th grade I found myself 
doing some basic research on the utilities that software engineers know (The most popular programming languages and then looked into different platfroms that you could code in Java), I have been knowing about Eclipse, Android Studio, Microsoft Visual Studio and IntelliJ IDEA.
