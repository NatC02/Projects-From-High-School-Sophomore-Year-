# Projects-From-High-School-Sophomore-Year-
Some of the projects that I have done in school.(12-02-18)

I have been coding since Freshman Year with Android Studio in my previous course and continued on my own thoughout high school.(12-02-18)

I first became interested in being a software engineer when I was in 7th grade and by 8th grade I found myself 
doing some basic research on the utilities that software engineers know (I looked into the most popular programming languages and then looked into different platfroms that you could code in Java), Since then, I have been knowing about Eclipse, Android Studio, Microsoft Visual Studio and IntelliJ IDEA.
